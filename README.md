# Node js HTTP request to cURL
Tired to manually generate curl from nodejs request for debugging proposes? Need to export nodejs request to your REST client (e.g. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) and [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/))? http-to-curl come to the rescue!!


## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
```sh
yarn add http-to-curl
# old way
npm install http-to-curl --save

```

## Usage üìö
```js
// import httpToCurl on your server entry point of your project or code (e.g. server.js / index.js)
import httpToCurl from 'http-to-curl';
httpToCurl();
// Traditional way
const httpToCurl = require('http-to-curl').default;
httpToCurl();

//  Use your favorite http client to fetch (e.g. axios, isomorphic fetch or even vanilla request) all works well with http-to-curl.
//  In this example we are using axios.

import axios from 'axios'
const options = {
  url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
  method: 'get'
};

//Output
curl "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1" -X GET -H "Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*" -H "User-Agent: axios/0.18.0"

```
